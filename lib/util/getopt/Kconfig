config GETOPT
	bool "Geopt library support"
	help
	  This option adds support of the multi-instance getopt.
	  Different shell backends use their own instance of getopt state
	  structure.
	  There are two options if one wants to use getopt functions from
	  outside the shell thread. If getopt is called from only one thread
	  it can be done straight forward. The getopt functions will use
	  a single getopt state structure created in the lib_getoptvars.c
	  file.
	  However, if getopt is expected to be called from multiple threads,
	  you must modify the struct getopt_s *getoptvars(void) function
	  in the lib_getoptvars.c file so that it returns a separate getopt
	  state structure for each thread.
